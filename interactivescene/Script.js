// City Scene V 2.0 (Updated with State Variables)
// By: William Ahiahonu
// Computer Science 30
// March 19th, 2018

// Extra for experts attempt (ones that are new to this version of the project):
// - Implemented the "rbga" concept for the background changes, the sun, the moon,
// the building windows and the stars.
// - Implemented the functions, Math.floor() and Math.random() to randomly load
// different background music every time the project is opened.
// - Implemented a "for item in array" loop for iterating through an array for the
// windows to be generated on the buildings. Also implemented the math concept of
// transformations in order to better fit the windows into the buildings.

// Global Variables set to be used later in the code.
