William Ahiahonu's CS30 Major Project

Proposal:

The topic chosen to delve into for my major project is to create a simple, sleek looking operating system using javascript. The current idea is to create an illusion of an operating system, meaning that when it opens in the browser, the window will automatically full screen, scrolling is disabled for the browser and so on. Furthermore, I have been looking at ways of making the program boot from a USB automatically by creating a compiler of some sort. However, this will depend on time left after creating the actual program and how much I can learn about making a compiler in the time frame provided.

Must Have:

- Opening screen, welcoming user (with music).
- Functional password bar that takes user to desktop.
- Simple settings app.
- Incorporate already made projects as applications.
- Button to “shut down” program
- Program runs in browser as an illusion of an operating system.

Nice to Have:

- Fading animations for aesthetic purposes (not just front screen)
- Music application (with nice, olden day song playlists)
- Button to “Log out” and not necessarily shut down all the time
- Drag and drop functionality
- Application for notes (dumbed down version of Microsoft word- will take more of the form of, for example, a MacBook, “Notes” app)
- Program boots automatically from USB using JavaScript to C compiler 

Why this topic?

The reason why I chose this topic is because I always found it intriguing how operating systems work and what occurs behind the scenes. I will be able to learn new things along the way, even if they don’t fully make it into my project.

Timeline:

May 12th-13th - Read about compiler’s and how achievable it is to make one. Also begin working on opening screen.

May 14th-17th - Complete opening screen; begin creating login screen and desktop design.

May 18th-26th - Continue working on desktop design.

27th-2nd - Work on settings app. Incorporate already made projects as applications. Make music application.

3rd-9th - Work on settings app. Incorporate already made projects as applications. Make music application.

10th-15th - Incorporate final app for the system (paint app) and fix up any hiccups.
